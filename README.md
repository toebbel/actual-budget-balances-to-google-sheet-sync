# Actual Budget To Google Sheets Link

Syncs my actual budlget to Google Sheets.
Does also a bunch of statistics that might not be helpful for other folks.
Please feel free to pick any code you find useful.

`yarn run quick-sync` will sync the budget without running a bank sync.
`yarn run full-sync` will sync the budget without running a bank sync.

For full control: `npx ts-node index.ts <flags>`
